# development details
Using Xlib. I want to focus on the game mechanics rather than performance in this early stage, so decided to use Xlib -the library of the X Server.
In this game, I will continue on my previous -unfinished- game project (That was written in Python.).

# game details
Meeting the computer and the internet since I was born (2001), I have been playing browser and computer games since I know how to read! Since those young ages, I have always imagined making my own game where I can add any functionality I wanted. This 2d game is one of the milestones of my dream. 
This is a 2d game, inspired from Total War and Age of Empires series. I will be implementing some aspects of both of the series as time progresses.
